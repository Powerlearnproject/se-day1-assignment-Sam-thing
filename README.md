Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

->Software engineering is the process of creating softwares to do specific tasks. It has proven to be important in the advancement, efficiency and productivity of fields like medicine and agriculture since engineers create tools that automate tasks


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

->1. High level Programming Languages were brought in. before then programming was done using machine language.
2. Then Structured Programming was brought in which introduced aspects like loops and Conditions to structure programmes
3. Object Oriented Programming introduced software design around objects which encalpsulates data and behaviours making it easier to manage large and more complex software projects


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

->1. Planning and Requirement analysis, which is where one identifies the needs and goals of the software
2. System design where the architecture of the software is defined
3. coding where using the programming languages and other developer tools one develops the software components
4. Testing and Debugging. is where the software is run through a series of tests to check for error and trhose identified are corrected
5. Deployment. This is where the already tested software is implemented
6. Maintenance. The software is monitored for for faults and upgrades are made to improve it's functionality

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
1. Waterfall uses a sequential and linear approach where each phase is completed before moving to the next stage where as Agile divided development into small, incremental cycles called sprints
2. Waterfall method doesn't adapt to changes in development processes while Agile is very flexible thus adapting efficiently
3. An example of a project that use the waterfall method is when the Requirements are well understood and are unlikely to change like Manuracturing Systems, while in Agile projects the requirement may change at any moment like in Tech innovation projects
   

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

1. Software Developer Designs, Developes and maintains softwares
2. Project Managers Oversee the Software Development process allocating resorces, assigning tasks, comminicating with the stakeholders and presenting the software project
3. Assurance Engineer evaluates the Software to determine whether it meets the organization's standards.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

             ///////IDEs/////
1. It provides advanced code editors that help developers write code more efficiently with few errors
2. It has Degguging tools that helps make it easier to identify and fix issues in the code
3. It has Intergrated tools for version control, testing and deployment which streamlines the development process.
   >>>>>> Example Mercurial.

             //////VCS///////
   1. Version Control Systems Allow for multiple developers to work together and work on the same project simultaneously
   2. Its has Change Tracking Mechanisms that tracks the history of code changes, providing a record of who changed what part of the code mostly for accountability amongst developers 
   3. It also provides a Backup system and Recovery for codebase to ensure the code chages are not lost.
      >>>examples are Git and Subversions

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

1. Software engineers find it hard to keep uo with the rapid evolution of technology, new languages, frameworks and tools emerging.
   - this can be solved by continuous learning
2. Constant Security Threats
   - This can be solved by implementing security practices such as encryption and and regular security audits.
3.  Ensuring Code Quality and Maintainability is also a challange especially in large projects
   - By adopting practices such as code review, pair programming and automated testing tools one can improve the code quality.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

1. Unit testing is the testing of individual components of the software called units.
   - it helps catch bugs earlier on in the project
2. Integration testing mainly focuses on verifying the interaction between integrated components.
   - this uncovers issues related to the integrated components or modules
3. System Testing is where the software application is tested as a whole
   - System Testing Thoroughly validated the complete system ensuring all components are in synch.
4. Acceptance Testing verifies that the system meets the users needs and expectations.
   - Acceptance Testing tell the Developers whether the created system is ready for deployment.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

-> Prompt Engineering is the process of designing input prompts to effectively interact with AI models.

1. Prompt Engineering has helped reduce ambiguity and increased precision
2. It has enhanced creative outputs from AI models.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt: 
    - White about AI and Prompt Engineering -
Improved Prompt:
    - Write a 300 word article explaining what both AI and Prompt Engineering are giving examples and their importance in Technology.
